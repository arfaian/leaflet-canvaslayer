leaflet-canvaslayer
===================

A leaflet plugin that provides a <canvas> layer allowing WebGL.

Ported from https://github.com/brendankenny/CanvasLayer to work with Leaflet, had to reverse engineer Google's projection algorithm to make the points draw correctly.  I'm clearly missing something there, so if someone wants to show me how it's done using Leaflet's API let me know!
